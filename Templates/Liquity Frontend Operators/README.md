# What's Liquity?

Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD pegged stablecoin, and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.

In addition to collateral, the loans are secured by a [Stability Pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations) containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable and governance-free. 



# Why doesn't the Liquity team run its own frontend?

To ensure the decentralized nature of the Liquity protocol from day one, the Liquity team will not host or run a frontend to interact with the Liquity contracts. Not running our own frontend increases censorship resistance and decentralization, but also helps us bootstrap a distributed ecosystem. The Liquity team encourages more frontend operators to participate in managing the Liquity frontend, and as operators, they will receive a portion of the LQTY tokens generated through user staking as a reward for their services.
